Well, after more than a decade running Bootstrap <tt>v1.2.0</tt> ðŸ¤¯ I
decided to finally bite the bullet and update the blog design. The old
design was fun but it wasn't responsive at all, which has become
increasingly problematic.

I'm now using [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) for this blog's front-end
framework, which has been an absolute delight to work with. Pico leverages
modern browser features (grid, flexbox) which reduces extraneous containers
and class names, resulting in simpler, more readable html.

RIP, old friend.
