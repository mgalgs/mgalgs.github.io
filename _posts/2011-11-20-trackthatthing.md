## Overview

[Track That Thing](http://www.trackthatthing.com/) is the first Android
application I've developed. It allows you to easily record and share your
location in real-time. It's available for free
[on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mgalgs.trackthatthing).
The source code for the Android app and Django backend is
[on GitHub](https://github.com/mgalgs/trackthatthing).

## How TTT Was Born

When I was interviewing around the country for my first engineering job in
late 2010 I wanted to share my location in real-time with my wife back in
California so that she could kind of "come along for the ride" and help
decide which place would be the best fit for us. After some searching in
the Android Market I began to notice that all of the real-time location
sharing apps were pretty much disgusting or weren't free. I had been
looking for an interesting idea to get my feet wet in Android development,
so I decided to write one myself. (I have since discovered
[glympse](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse),
which is a very awesome app that does exactly what I originally
wanted. However, I'm glad I didn't find it because I never would have made
TrackThatThing. Also, I think TrackThatThing is simpler to use than
glympse.)
